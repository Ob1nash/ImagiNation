# Project Title (Replace with your project name)

A full-stack application with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend.

## Overview

This project consists of two main parts:

- **`client/`**: A React application built with Vite, styled using Tailwind CSS. It handles user interface and interactions.
- **`server/`**: A Node.js backend built with Express.js. It manages data, authentication, business logic, and interacts with a database (likely MongoDB via Mongoose) and payment gateways (Razorpay, Stripe).

## Features

_(Describe the key features of your application here. What problems does it solve? What does it allow users to do?)_

- User authentication (Signup/Login)
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]
- Payment integration with Razorpay and Stripe

## Tech Stack

**Client:**

- React
- Vite
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios
- Framer Motion
- React Toastify

**Server:**

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Mongoose (MongoDB)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- bcrypt
- dotenv
- Cors
- Razorpay SDK
- Stripe SDK

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)
- API Keys for Razorpay and Stripe

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Setup Server:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

    - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory by copying the example file:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Edit the `.env` file and add your actual credentials and configuration values. Refer to `.env.example` for the required variables (e.g., `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, payment keys, etc.).

3.  **Setup Client:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory.
    - Add the backend server URL to the `client/.env` file. Remember that Vite requires environment variables to be prefixed with `VITE_`:
      ```env
      VITE_API_URL=<your_backend_server_url> # e.g., http://localhost:5000
      ```
    - Ensure your client-side code (e.g., Axios configuration) reads this environment variable (`import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`) to connect to the backend.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Server:**

    ```bash
    cd ../server
    npm run server # For development with nodemon
    # OR
    npm start    # For production
    ```

    The server should start on the port specified in your `.env` file (e.g., 5000).

2.  **Start the Client:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm run dev
    ```
    The client development server will typically start on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default) or another specified port. Open this URL in your browser.

## Deployment

_(Add notes on how to deploy the application, if applicable. Mention platforms like Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, AWS, etc.)_

The `client` and `server` directories contain `vercel.json` files, suggesting potential deployment configurations for Vercel.
